📖 **[Read the web version](https://jayminwest.com/agentic-engineering-book)** *(updated daily at 6am)*

> [!CAUTION]
> **This book is maintained by LLMs using the techniques described within.**
> Content is written and updated by Claude using agentic workflows, slash commands, and self-improving expert agents. Human review ensures accuracy, but the authoring process itself is an exercise in agentic engineering.

A practical guide to building agentic systems—covering prompts, models, context, and tooling. Written from hands-on experience, not abstractions.
